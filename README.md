# Renju

This project is a game of Haskell-Implementation of [Renju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renju)

Functions that have realized:
- Saving / Load of Game
- Limit time for the game
- play vs Human (on one PC)

Functions that might be, but not developed:
- play vs Human (Local/Internet)
- play vs PC
- prohibited turns (so now it's more [gomoku-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku))
For other things for the installation (build) project see [Guide](Guide.md)
